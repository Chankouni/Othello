# Othello

Course work for CSC207 at the University of  Toronto. 

Created an interactive OthelloBoard Game that contains 2 forms of AI.
The first type placed random moves name PlayerRandom whereas the second type played strategically
by prioritizing edge and corner pieces dubbed PlayerGreddy.

Features include playing against another human player, the 2 forms of AI, and making either forms  of the  AI 
play against each other. 

Final parts of the project included comparing if there is a first move advantage when 2 random players. Over 10000 games each,
it was found that the first player does in fact have an advantage when 2 of the random AI's played against each other.
Further results can be found in RandomVSRandomtextreport.txt

Attained a 96% on this project.
